## Visualize Quicksort

The goal at the end is to render something like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#/media/File:Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif. Don't worry about the smaller details such as the arrows

You're also given a few pieces of starter code to help you get started:

- An inplace quicksort algorithm
- A function to generate a randomized array.

Goals:

1. Render a bar graph with their respective heights.
2. Animate going from an unsorted bar graph to a sorted bar graph using the quicksort algorithm.

### To run the project:

```
npm start
```
